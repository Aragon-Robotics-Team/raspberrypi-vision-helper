# Raspberry Pi Vision Helper

## A set of gradle configurations for the [WPILib FRC Vision Pi-Gen](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/85074/l/1027260-installing-the-image-to-your-microsd-card) Image

### Developed by: [Aragon Robotics Team 840](http://aragonrobotics.org)

This repository contains files meant to be installed as a subdirectory of a greater RoboRIO Java project, such as the one generated by the WPILib VSCode extension. Once installed, you can compile and deploy your vision code to a Raspberry Pi in the same way you compile and deploy to the RoboRIO. This project will simplify your workflow by allowing you to have one repository for both your robot code and your vision code.

This is not limited to Visual Studio Code. As long as you use Gradle and the [GradleRIO](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/GradleRIO) plugin, you're good to go. You don't have to change your workflow at all.

#### Compatible with the WPILib VSCode extension.

`./gradlew deploy`

#### Compile, but not deploy, RoboRIO Robot Code and Raspberry Pi vision code simultaneously:

#### Compile and deploy only the Raspberry Pi vision code:

`./gradlew :vision:deploy`
